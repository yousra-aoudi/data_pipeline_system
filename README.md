# data_pipeline_system

A portfolio trade execution data pipeline is a system that collects, processes, and analyzes data related to the
execution of trades within a portfolio. This data can include information on the timing and cost of trades, as well as
other factors that may affect the execution of trades, such as market volatility or liquidity. By analyzing this data,
portfolio managers can gain insights into the performance of their portfolios and make informed decisions about how to
optimize their trading strategies.

This repository contains Python code for constructing portfolio trade execution data pipelines and analyzing the market 
impact of portfolio trades across markets. The pipeline is built using Python, SQL, and Scikit-learn, and is designed to
extract, preprocess, and analyze trade execution data to predict the trading costs of different securities.

Overview
The steps to build a portfolio trade execution data pipeline in Python, SQL, and Scikit-learn include:

- Connect to a database containing data related to portfolio trade execution.
- Preprocess and clean the data as needed.
- Use SQL to perform basic analyses of the data.
- Use Python and Scikit-learn to engineer features and build models to predict trading costs.
- Determine the market impact of portfolio trades across markets by analyzing the data and using the models developed in 
the previous step.

Features

This project offers the following features:
- Extracting trade execution data from a database using an SQL query.
- Preprocessing the data to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis.
- Using SQL to perform basic analyses of the data, such as calculating summary statistics or identifying trends over time.
- Engineering features using Python and Scikit-learn to build models for predicting OTC and listed derivatives trading costs.
- Analyzing the market impact of portfolio trades across markets using data analysis and modeling techniques.

Usage

To use this repository, clone it to your local machine and run the Python scripts to extract, preprocess, and analyze trade execution data.
