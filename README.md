# data_pipeline_system

A portfolio trade execution data pipeline is a system that collects, processes, and analyzes data related to the
execution of trades within a portfolio. This data can include information on the timing and cost of trades, as well as
other factors that may affect the execution of trades, such as market volatility or liquidity. By analyzing this data,
portfolio managers can gain insights into the performance of their portfolios and make informed decisions about how to
optimize their trading strategies.

This repository contains Python code for constructing portfolio trade execution data pipelines and analyzing the market 
impact of portfolio trades across markets. The pipeline is built using Python, SQL, and Scikit-learn, and is designed to
extract, preprocess, and analyze trade execution data to predict the trading costs of different securities.

Features
- Data Collection: Collect data from diverse sources such as financial statements, news articles, and economic indicators.
- Data Cleaning and Pre-processing: Clean and pre-process the data to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis.
- Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features from the data that can be used for stock return forecasting and model building.
- Model Building: Build and implement quantitative equity investment models using algorithms such as regression, decision trees, or neural networks.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Portfolio Construction: Construct portfolios based on the predictions made by the models and optimize them for maximum returns.
- Risk Management: Monitor and manage the risk associated with the portfolios to ensure that they are in line with the risk tolerance of the investors.

Usage
To use this data pipeline, follow these general steps:

1. Connect to a database containing data related to portfolio trade execution, using libraries such as psycopg2 to establish a connection and issue SQL queries to extract the data that you need.
2. Preprocess and clean the data as needed, using SQL to filter out irrelevant records or using Python to handle missing values or format dates.
3. Use SQL to perform basic analyses of the data, such as calculating summary statistics or identifying trends over time.
4. Use Python and Scikit-learn to engineer features and build models to predict securities trading costs.
5. Determine the market impact of portfolio trades across global markets by analyzing the data and using the models developed in step 4.
6. Use the insights and findings from the data analysis to inform portfolio management decisions and optimize trading strategies.
